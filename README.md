# Discord-Group-Chat-Spam-Ringer
Story behind this, my friends didn't want to answer the call, so I decided to make an automatic ringer so I don't have to waste my brain capacity clicking ring over and over and over and over again.



Make sure you put your discord token in the config.json file.
I dont have a sleep function on the script so you have to just close it to stop the request or add one yourself.
