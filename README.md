# Discord-Group-Chat-Spam-Ringer
Story behind this, my friends didn't want to answer the call, so I decided to make an automatic ringer so I don't have to waste my brain capacity clicking ring over and over and over and over again.



Make sure you put your discord token in the config.json file.
I dont have a sleep function on the script so you have to just close it to stop the request or add one yourself.


ALSO CHANGE THE REQUEST POST URL TO THE GROUP CHAT YOUR IN AND ALSO I RAN THE PROGRAM AND IT WOULDNT STOP RUNNING FOR SOME REASON SOOOOOO IDKK

THIS IS RISKY SO PLEASE USE WITH CAUTION
